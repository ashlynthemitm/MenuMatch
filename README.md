MenuMatch is an application designed to help Georgia State University students discover nearby restaurants that meet their specific preferences. The project utilizes a combination of MySQL, Python, Flask, JavaScript, and HTML technologies. Users can input their personal requirements through a form, and the application generates a tailored list of restaurants based on factors such as food type, allergens, and user ratings. This project addresses challenges faced by students in finding affordable, suitable dining options near campus, offering a more personalized and user-friendly experience compared to generic food delivery services like Doordash. The application aims to simplify the process of discovering and selecting restaurants by considering factors such as class schedules, budget constraints, and proximity to the campus.
